# Current state

Last updated: 2026-09-07. Maintainer: Lucas Santana ([thepianistdirector](https://github.com/thepianistdirector)). This file is the mutable status authority; TASKS.md and plan/tasks.json are synchronized projections.

## Architecture foundation accepted

The active root accepted the three foundation tasks in dependency order under Lucas Santana's explicit instruction to complete and publish this first architecture round. The reviewed source is the foundation commit on `main` containing this file, whose parent is `94608775e6f93815688fa3e0e14b7e9332443dc7`. This acceptance covers documentation and executable repository-plan tooling. It does not establish scientific validity, implemented simulation, user validation or a released product.

| Task | State | Acceptance evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VR-F01 | **DONE** | Architecture, experiment and source contracts reviewed; scientific boundaries, evaluator isolation and explicit failure semantics accepted as design requirements. |
| VR-F02 | **DONE** | Roadmap and task graph reviewed; all 24 original contracts and eight scientific gates preserved, with only the foundation entry dependency added. |
| VR-F03 | **DONE** | Next-work packet reviewed; python3 tools/validate_plan.py and eight root negative probes passed on the accepted foundation diff. |
| VR-001 | **PLANNED** | Original scientific/build acceptance remains open. |
| VR-002 | **PLANNED** | Original scientific/build acceptance remains open. |
| VR-003 | **PLANNED** | Original scientific/build acceptance remains open. |

## Reproduced verification

- `python3 tools/validate_plan.py` — **PASS** on the accepted foundation: 27 tasks, nine waves and 71 dependency edges.
- Root negative probes in disposable copies — **PASS**: missing dependency, cycle, malformed dependency, Boolean wave, empty owned paths, wrong project, non-object root and TASKS.md status drift were all rejected cleanly.
- Original-plan comparison against the parent revision — **PASS**: all 24 original task objects retain their IDs, title, wave, acceptance, owned paths, PLANNED state and prior dependencies; VR-001 adds only VR-F03.
- All eight original scientific gates — **PRESERVED**.
- `git diff --check` — **PASS**.

These checks verify plan consistency and failure handling. They do not prove the architecture's scientific validity or any simulation result.

## Next work and limits

VR-001 is the next eligible bounded packet. Its work instructions, owned paths, acceptance, unresolved decisions and stop conditions are in [TASKS.md](TASKS.md). Original tasks VR-001 through VR-024 remain **PLANNED**; scientific work has not started.

Exact benchmark/model/data choices, reuse rights, compatible numerical dependencies, allocated hardware/compute, qualified domain review and protected-evaluator runtime evidence remain unresolved where their tasks require them. No dependency, model weights or dataset was installed or acquired for this foundation. No benchmark compute, hosted research service or physical-system connection was run.

Current implementation: project architecture, roadmap, task contracts, source and experiment requirements, next-work instructions and standard-library plan validation only. Runtime, scientific/performance outcomes, independent reproduction and user validation remain **NOT TESTED / NONE CLAIMED**.

GitHub is the source for this completed architecture batch. Tanduna's native publication and execution states are separate: the owner story may link this evidence, but a native task must not be marked as a runner-reviewed completion without that workflow's evidence.
